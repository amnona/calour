The PCR primers (F515/R806) were developed against the V4 region of the 16S rRNA (both bacteria and archaea), which we determined would yield optimal community clustering with reads of this length using a procedure similar to that of ref. 15. [For reference, this primer pair amplifies the region 533_786 in the Escherichia coli strain 83972 sequence (greengenes accession no. prokMSA_id:470367).] The reverse PCR primer is barcoded with a 12-base error-correcting Golay code to facilitate multiplexing of up to _1,500 samples per lane, and both PCR primers contain sequencer adapter regions.
